          The PMU present on these ARM cores allow for the use of counters to
          monitor the memory latency characteristics of an ARM CPU workload.
          This driver uses these counters to implement the APIs needed by
          the mem_latency devfreq governor.

          HW monitor based governor for device to DDR bandwidth voting.
          This governor sets the CPU BW vote based on stats obtained from memalat
          monitor if it determines that a workload is memory latency bound. Since
          this uses target specific counters it can conflict with existing profiling
          tools.

          Different devfreq governors use this devfreq device to make CPU to
          DDR bandwidth votes. This driver provides a SoC topology
          agnostic interface to so that some of the devfreq governors can be
          shared across SoCs.
